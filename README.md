# ICS3U1-Culminating-Word-Hunt-
This is my sort of scuffed version of Word Hunt (the iOS game that's just a knockoff of Boggle) that I made for my comp sci culminating !

## Rules etc
So basically it works the same as the actual game, you instead just click and drag your mouse over the letters you'd like to select and let go when you want to lock in your guess. It's a bit silly though sometimes and might not register something correctly, so just go back over the tile if that happens! (Hopefully I'll remaster this one day and fix this issue)

The board continuously randomizes each game so it's also infinitely playable!
